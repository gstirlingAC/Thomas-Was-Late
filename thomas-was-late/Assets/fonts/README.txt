Download a font as per the instructions by the lecturer.

Suitable free fonts can be found at the following websites:
https://www.dafont.com/
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/
https://fonts.google.com/

--(There are many others as well, these are the ones I use most frequently)--

Ensure when you download a font, you download the TrueType Format (.ttf).
